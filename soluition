1. <script>alert(document.domain);</script>
    As the Hint is very simple, so it should be the very basic script
    
2. ></script>">'><script>alert(document.domain);</script>
    The above line is joining of two java script code the joiner being ">'> as the js is blocking the first </script>

3. ></script>">'><script>alert(document.domain);</script>
    This time '>' and '<' are properly blocked so you have to write this code in the 'select'(Drop Down Menu) field of 
    the HTML code, you can do so by going to the inspect element of the 'select'(Drop Down Menu) field.

4. ></script>">'><script>alert(document.domain);</script>
    Now paste the same code in the search filed and before clicking on the submit button start tamper data and then click on submit
    on the wondow of temper data you will see a hidden field, now paste the code in this text filed and hit submit 

5. ></script>">'><script>alert(document.domain);</script>
    In this challenge they have limited the length of the input field, to overcome this start temper data paste the code in the 
    search field.

6. "onmouseover = "alert(document.domain);" 
    As the hint suggests, this one has something to do with events so this simple event handler code will do the work with just a
    double quote infront of it.

7. xss onmouseover = alert(document.domain)
    Now they are escaping the quotes. So we are just going to avoid them, due the property of js we can do so.

8. javascript:alert(document.domain);
    The  hint says the 'javascript' scheme so just writing in the old js coding style, works fine.

9. alert(document.domain);
    Paste the above code in the firefox's console box. As this problem can not be solved.
    
10. " onmouseover = "alert(document.domaidomainn)"
    Going with the hint and after trying different codes i realised that it is omiting some of my character 
    from the code so i came up with this code finally
